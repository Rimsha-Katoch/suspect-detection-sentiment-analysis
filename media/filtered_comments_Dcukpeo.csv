I love everybody
let their walls crumble and their cities burn
they will beg for mercy but none will be given
we will strike fear into their hearts with every step we take
we must stand together against terror
a peaceful heart leads to a peaceful world
we must retaliate against them
violence is the only language they understand
justice should be served in any way possible
they will pay for their actions
the streets will run red with their blood
we will bring darkness upon them
